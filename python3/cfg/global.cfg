[General]
; Set a delay (in milliseconds) for encryption, decryption and key generation.
; This will decrease the CPU usage, but also slow down the process. This also
; affects the Erfr Extractor as well as the Erfr Obfuscator component. The
; higher the delay, the slower the process.
;     0 = minimum (no delay, default)
;   100 = maximum

; Automatically use "os.urandom()" as pseudo-random number generator (without
; raising an exception) in case the requested one is not available.
;     0 = disabled (default)
;     1 = enabled

; file inside the parameter file.

[Extractor]
; Always remove the used bytes from the key file to avoid using the same key
; (or any parts of it), regardless whether the corresponding command-line
; argument was given or not.

[TaskID]
; Disable the task ID feature. In case the user sets a task ID manually, it
