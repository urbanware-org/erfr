    1. Definition

        The Erfr Cleaner script removes remaining Erfr task files, if they
        have not been deleted automatically for some reason.

        For details about task IDs (and task files) see section 8 inside the
        documentation for the main Erfr script.

    2. General stuff

        2.1 How to run Python scripts

            All usage examples below show how to execute the Python scripts on
            the shell of a Unix-like system. If you do not know, how to run
            those scripts on your operating system, you may have a look at
            this page:

                http://www.urbanware.org/howto_python.html

        2.2 Overview of all command-line arguments

            Usually, each script requires command-line arguments to operate.
            So, to get an overview of all arguments available, simply run the
            script with the "--help" argument. For example:

                $ ./erfr-cleaner.py --help

    3. Delete remaining temporary Erfr files

        In case an Erfr process has been cancelled or not completed properly
        and some of the temporary Erfr files have not been automatically
        deleted for some reason, they can be removed manually.

        It is strongly recommended to delete those files when there are no
        Erfr processes running.

        Now, to delete the temporary files, simply run the script without any
        arguments:

            $ ./erfr-cleaner.py

        The script deletes all temporary files automatically. There is no way
        to give a certain task ID, due to the fact, that this script should be
        run once to clean up after all Erfr processes have been completed.
