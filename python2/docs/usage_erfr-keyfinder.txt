    1. Definition

        The Erfr Key Finder script helps to find the corresponding key for an
        encrypted file and vice versa.

        2.1 How to run Python scripts

            All usage examples below show how to execute the Python scripts on
            the shell of a Unix-like system. If you do not know, how to run
            those scripts on your operating system, you may have a look at
            this page:

                http://www.urbanware.org/howto_python.html

        2.2 Overview of all command-line arguments

            Usually, each script requires command-line arguments to operate.
            So, to get an overview of all arguments available, simply run the
            script with the "--help" argument. For example:

                $ ./erfr-keyfinder.py --help

    3. Find the corresponding key file

        For example, to find the corresponding key for the encrypted file
        "foobar.enc" inside the directory "/tmp/keys", type:

            $ ./erfr-keyfinder.py -f foobar.enc -d /tmp/keys

        If the key or encrypted file has been obfuscated, further command-line
        arguments are required.

        For example, if the key file has been obfuscated with 128 bytes and
        the encrypted file with 64 bytes, type:

            $ ./erfr-keyfinder.py -f foobar.enc -d /tmp/keys -k 128 -e 64
