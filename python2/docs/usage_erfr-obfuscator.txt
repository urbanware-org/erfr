    1. Definition

        The Erfr Obfuscator is an afterwards obfuscation (post-obfuscation)
        script that allows obfuscating already existing encrypted and key
        files by adding random bytes.

    2. General stuff

        2.1 How to run Python scripts

            All usage examples below show how to execute the Python scripts on
            the shell of a Unix-like system. If you do not know, how to run
            those scripts on your operating system, you may have a look at
            this page:

                http://www.urbanware.org/howto_python.html

        2.2 Overview of all command-line arguments

            Usually, each script requires command-line arguments to operate.
            So, to get an overview of all arguments available, simply run the
            script with the "--help" argument. For example:

                $ ./erfr-obfuscator.py --help

        2.3 Pseudo-random number generators

            See section 2.3 inside the documentation for the main Erfr script.

    3. Obfuscate a file

        When using the file obfuscation feature, the amount of random bytes
        for the encrypted and the key file should NOT be identical, because
        this would result in files with the same size again.

        Please also keep in mind that the obfuscation values used to encrypt
        are required to properly decrypt the encrypted data again.

        For example, if you want to obfuscate a key file called "foobar.key"
        by adding 1024 random bytes, the command line would look like this:

            $ ./erfr-obfuscator.py -f foobar.key -r 1024
